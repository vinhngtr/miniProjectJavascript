        This book intentionally covers more breadth and depth than any course would cover in a
semester. It is accessible for a first undergraduate course in VLSI, yet detailed enough for
advanced graduate courses and is useful as a reference to the practicing engineer. You are
encouraged to pick and choose topics according to your interest. <br>

Chapter 1 previews the
entire field, while subsequent chapters elaborate on specific topics. Sections are marked
with the “Optional” icon (shown here in the margin) if they are not needed to understand
subsequent sections. You may skip them on a first reading and return when they are relevant to you. <br>
